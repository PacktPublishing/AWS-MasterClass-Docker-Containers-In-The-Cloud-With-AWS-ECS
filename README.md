## About the Video Course
In the past decade cloud computing has been gaining popularity at a tremendous rate. Some cloud providers are experiencing a growth rate of 50% year over year – which is just astounding. And the reasons for this growth is obvious – cloud computing enables ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal effort. Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster at lower IT costs, and scale their applications. Along with the popularity of cloud platforms - another phenomenon which has been taking over the modern software and IT landscape is containerization. The use of container technology like Docker has grown dramatically within organizations of all sizes. But do you know what happens when you marry these two amazing technologies? The result is a massively scalable, robust and flexible infrastructure solution. If you are serious about architecting, deploying and operating containers and clusters in the AWS cloud – then this course is for you. Look, if you're serious about becoming an expert cloud engineer and generating a greater income for you and your family, it’s time to take action

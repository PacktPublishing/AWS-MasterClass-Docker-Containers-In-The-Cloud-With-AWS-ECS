       Feedback:
Incorrect if (a) is chosen: This is not the correct option. EC2 container service manage the state of cluster, it gives you all the events happening in your cluster and it gives you the current status of your cluster. But this is not the only feature.
Incorrect if (b) is chosen. This is not correct option. Ec2 Container service, allows you to schedule containers in multiple ways. You can use your Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of your container across your cluster and also you can integrate your own scheduler or third party scheduler. But this is not the only feature.
Incorrect if (c) is chosen. This is not correct option. You can launch ten or ten thousands of the Docker container in a second by using Amazon ECS with no additional complexity. But this is not the only feature.
Incorrect if (d) is chosen. This is not correct option. Amazon EC2 container service can be easily integrated or extended through the simple API. But this is not the only feature.
Correct if (e) is chosen. This is correct option. Actually, all of the above are the features provided by EC2 container services.

Correct if (c) is chosen. This is correct option. ECS container agent allows container instances to connect to your cluster.
Incorrect if (d) is chosen. This is not correct option.

14. To define the new security layer over the ECS services at the task level, you must create the task role inside task definition.
